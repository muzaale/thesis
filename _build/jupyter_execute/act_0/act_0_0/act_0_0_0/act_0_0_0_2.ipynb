    "# BACKGROUND\n",
    "   - #### Quantify nephrectomy-attributable risk of ESRD and mortality\n",
    "   - #### Describe the prevalence of hospitalizations in older donors vs. older nondonors\n",
    "   - #### Implement a risk calculator for ESRD, mortality, and sentinel hospitalization in older donors \n",
    "\n",
    "# METHODS\n",
    "\n",
    "![](design.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## $1-e^{-\\int h_0(t)exp(X\\beta)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- $h_0(t)$ is the nonparametric hazard for the base-case\n",
    "- $exp(X\\beta)$ is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the difference (on a log scale) between the hazard for the base-case and the hazard for the specific clinical scenario with explanatory variables $X$\n",
    "- $t$ is the number of years of follow-up (tentatively 15y but will update to 30y later in January).\n",
    "\n",
    "## RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "   - ### Nondonors\n",
    "      - We describe a base-case below:\n",
    "      - 60y\n",
    "      - White\n",
    "      - Female\n",
    "      - College Education\n",
    "      - BMI $24\\ kg/m^2$\n",
    "      - SBP $120\\ mmHg$ \n",
    "      - DBP $75\\ mmHg$\n",
    "      - eGFR $90\\ ml/min/1.73m^2$\n",
    "      - uACR 4 $mg/g$\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "   - ### Donors\n",
    "      - Missingness on key risk factors outlined above\n",
    "         - uACR is 100% missing for donors\n",
    "         - BMI, SBP, DBP, and eGFR conditionally missing (e.g. before 2005)\n",
    "         - Only age, race, and sex are 0% missing throughout the study period\n",
    "      - However, nondonor base-case informed by our prior beliefs about characteristics eligible donors\n",
    "      - Thus, instead of detailing history, exam, and lab findings, we only outlined demographics:\n",
    "         - Age\n",
    "         - Race\n",
    "         - Sex\n",

    "## CONCLUSIONS\n",
    "   - Will show that impact of donation on this base-case scenario is:\n",
    "      - SBP $+20\\text{mmHg}$\n",
    "      - eGFR $-30\\text{ml/min}$\n",
    "   - This is the nephrectomy attributable risk\n",
    "   - A webApp (online risk calculator) will allow a user to personalize the risk estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Our inferences have `face validity`:\n",
    "      - Grams et al NEJM 2016 reports similar risk to ours using scenario 6 of Table 3\n",
    "      - Donor followup studies report a 30% reduction in baseline eGFR after the 1st year of followup\n",
    "      - Increased blood pressure is observed following nephrectomy\n",
